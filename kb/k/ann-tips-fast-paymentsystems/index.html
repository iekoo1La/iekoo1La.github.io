The European Central Bank (ECB) is advancing its TARGET Instant Payment Settlement service (TIPS) to connect with global fast payment systems to enhance the global payments ecosystem.
Initiatives include implementing a cross-currency settlement service allowing exchanges between TIPS and other fast payment systems without direct links.
TIPS will join Project Nexus, led by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), to facilitate instant cross-border payments with selected Asian payment systems.
A bilateral link with India&rsquo;s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) will be established to improve cross-border payments, capitalizing on India&rsquo;s high transaction volumes and significant remittance inflows.
