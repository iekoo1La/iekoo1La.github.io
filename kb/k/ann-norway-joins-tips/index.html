The European Central Bank (ECB) and Norges Bank have signed an agreement  
allowing Norway to join the Eurosystem’s TARGET Instant Payment Settlement
(TIPS) service.
As part of this integration, the Norwegian krone will become the fourth   
currency available for instant payment settlement in TIPS, along with the 
euro, Swedish krona, and soon the Danish krone (due April 2025).
The inclusion of the Norwegian krone is scheduled for the first half of 2028,
offering Norway&rsquo;s market participants 24/7 instant payments in central bank
money.
ECB President Christine Lagarde highlighted Norway&rsquo;s participation as a step
towards stronger economic ties across Europe, marking Norway as the first 
non-EU European Economic Area country to join TIPS.
