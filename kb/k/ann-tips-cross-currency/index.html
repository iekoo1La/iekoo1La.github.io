<meta name=viewport content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1"><meta name=description content="
The European Central Bank (ECB) will implement a cross-currency settlement service in the TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) framework, allowing instant payments in one currency to settle in another using central bank money.
Initial currencies included will be euro, Swedish kronor, and Danish krone, with plans for future expansion to other currencies.
The initiative follows exploratory work from 2020 and involves collaboration with Sveriges Riksbank and Danmarks Nationalbank, alongside input from payment service providers (PSPs).
This service aims to enhance global payment systems, aligning with the G20 roadmap for efficient payments and supporting the Eurosystem’s strategy for cross-border transactions involving non-euro area partners.
